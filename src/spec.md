# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Simplify the site to only Home, About Us, and Get in Touch, and reduce the footer to a single Instagram link.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the Our Work/Portfolio, Pricing, and Packages (Package Details) sections so they are no longer visible on the page.
- Update the top navigation to only include Home and About Us, plus the existing Get in Touch call-to-action (remove Our Work, Pricing, Packages links from desktop and mobile menus).
- Update Home hero buttons so none link/scroll to the removed Portfolio/Our Work section, and all remaining CTAs scroll only to existing sections.
- Update the footer to remove Quick Links and Contact details entirely, leaving only a “Follow Us” area with a single Instagram link to `https://www.instagram.com/thestoriesbehindvows?igsh=bWdrN3o1M21meDBn`.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can navigate only to Home and About Us and use Get in Touch; the footer shows only one social link (Instagram) and no longer shows quick links, contact details, or other social icons.
