# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a responsive marketing website for a photography service with pages/sections for Home, About Us, Our Work (portfolio), Pricing, and Package Details, plus an inquiry CTA.

**Planned changes:**
- Add top navigation linking to Home, About Us, Our Work, Pricing, and Packages/Package Details.
- Build Home section with a hero image and service overview, using a warm editorial visual theme (cream/charcoal accents, serif headings + sans-serif body).
- Implement About Us page/section with a short story paragraph, 2–4 highlight cards, and a specialties list (e.g., weddings, portraits, events, product).
- Implement Our Work (Portfolio) gallery with category filters and lightbox/modal image preview.
- Implement Pricing page/section with at least 3 tiers (e.g., Basic/Standard/Premium) including price, short description, and inclusions.
- Implement Package Details page/section with per-package breakdown: duration/coverage, deliverables, turnaround time, add-ons, and booking terms.
- Add a Contact/Inquiry CTA with a form (name, email, event type, date, message) with basic validation; on submit, show success and store inquiry locally in browser state only.
- Add and reference generated static image assets from `frontend/public/assets/generated` (hero + portfolio placeholders).

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a cohesive, mobile-friendly photography website, view filtered portfolio work in a lightbox, compare pricing and detailed packages, and submit an inquiry form with an on-page success confirmation (no backend required).
