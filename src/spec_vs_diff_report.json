  "summary": "Brand name text is updated in key UI components (NavBar, Footer, About) and the inquiry success UI no longer shows a link/button to sent/received inquiries. The inquiry hook now clears the prior localStorage key and appears to submit via a backend mutation instead of persisting locally. However, the diff does not provide clear evidence that the #/received-inquiries route is no longer accessible, nor that form submission is actually blocked/disabled while the backend actor is still loading.",

      "requirement": "Replace \"The Stories By Vows\" with exactly \"The Stories Behind VOWS\" across the entire site UI (all user-facing occurrences, case-insensitive).",
      "reason": "The diff shows several updated occurrences, but does not provide evidence for all user-facing occurrences across the entire UI (e.g., other sections/pages not shown here).",

      "requirement": "Remove/disable the #/received-inquiries route so it is no longer accessible from the public UI (navigating to #/received-inquiries should not show the prior inquiries table page).",
      "reason": "While App.tsx shows no routing logic and the navbar no longer includes a My Inquiries link, the diff does not show any routing configuration change (e.g., removal of a route mapping) and the ReceivedInquiriesPage file is still present (no content shown). Therefore it is not evidenced that direct navigation to #/received-inquiries is prevented or falls back to a not-found/public view.",

      "requirement": "Prevent inquiry submission while the backend actor is still loading/unavailable (block submission/disable submit) so normal use does not produce the failure message.",
      "reason": "ContactSection computes an `isActorReady` flag, but the provided (truncated) content does not show it being used to disable/block form submission or prevent `handleSubmit` from being called when the actor is unavailable.",
