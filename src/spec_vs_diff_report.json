  "summary": "Diff implements a single-page responsive photography marketing site with navigation and sections for Home, About, Portfolio (with filters + lightbox), Pricing (3 tiers), Packages (accordion-style details), and Contact form with validation and local (sessionStorage) storage. However, it also adds unrequested Internet Identity/auth-related infrastructure and a backend actor stub, which are outside the BuildRequest/non-goals. Evidence for generated image files existing under frontend/public/assets/generated is not present in the readable diff (only UI references are shown).",
