  "architectural_notes": [
    "Visual direction updated to a clean, minimal style (supersedes prior warm editorial styling guidance).",
    "Deployment/site domain slug should be a short hyphenated name; user-provided slug: \"vows-site\".",

    "Branding update expanded: replace \"Lumiere Studio\" with \"The Stories By Vows\" everywhere on the site (all pages/sections), not only homepage chrome.",
    "Scope change: remove Pricing, Package Details, and Our Work/Portfolio pages; only Home, About Us, and Get in Touch should be visible.",
    "Footer update: remove Quick Links and Contact Details; add Instagram link under Follow Us (https://www.instagram.com/thestoriesbehindvows?igsh=bWdrN3o1M21meDBn).",

    "Requirement: provide two URLs/entry points — a public client-facing site for sending inquiries, and a separate private office/admin area/page for viewing received inquiries (not visible to clients).",
    "Note: current inquiry storage is local-only (per browser). A true office/admin URL for receiving/viewing inquiries across devices may require shared persistence/auth beyond local browser storage."
